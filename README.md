# Snake-and-Ladder-Game
With the help of Tkinter and turtle module and using Graphical User Interface [GUI] I have created this Snake and Ladder's game in Python.

Just for fun I have made some special changes in the game.

1) When we climb a ladder we generally go up but at top of ladder we have a snake there so we again come down.
Here people think that they are going up but again they come down.

2) When we fall on snake generally we go down but at the tail of the snake we have a ladder so we climb it and go up.
Here people think that they will go down but they are coming up.
